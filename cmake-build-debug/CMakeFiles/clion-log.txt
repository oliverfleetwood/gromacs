-- pkg-config could not detect fftw3f, trying generic detection
Could not find fftw3f library named libfftw3f, please specify its location in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or FFTWF_LIBRARY by hand (e.g. -DFFTWF_LIBRARY='/path/to/libfftw3f.so')
CMake Error at cmake/gmxManageFFTLibraries.cmake:93 (MESSAGE):
  Cannot find FFTW 3 (with correct precision - libfftw3f for mixed-precision
  GROMACS or libfftw3 for double-precision GROMACS).  Either choose the right
  precision, choose another FFT(W) library (-DGMX_FFT_LIBRARY), enable the
  advanced option to let GROMACS build FFTW 3 for you
  (-DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON), or use the really slow GROMACS built-in fftpack
  library (-DGMX_FFT_LIBRARY=fftpack).
